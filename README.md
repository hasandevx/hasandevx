# 👋 Hi there, I'm Hasan Rezaee

🧑‍💻 **Flutter Developer** | UI perfectionist | Architecture nerd  

🔥 **Firebase + Supabase** on the backend — I whisper to Firestore and charm SQL with Supabase  
🧠 Fluent in **PFA** (Thomas Burkhart’s architecture — yes, *that* one)  
🐣 Raised by **GetX**, trained in **Riverpod**, and still make `setState` cry sometimes  

🎨 If it’s not smooth, fast, and beautiful, it’s not shipping  

## 📲 Built & launched 4 public apps  
*(Yes, real ones — not just stuck in dev mode 😎)*  

- 🎵 [**XioMusic**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasanmadenotex.xio_music): MP3 & Music player  
- 🎙️ [**EZRecorder**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasanmadenotex.ez_recorder): Fun audio recorder  
- 🎚️ [**AZRecorder**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasanmadenotex.az_recorder): Minimalistic audio recorder  
- 📘 [**English Idioms**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hasanffdevaf.english_idioms_x1): Learn idioms the fun way

☕ Powered by caffeine and last-minute bug fixes  
🚀 Always building, breaking, and rebuilding
